This post walks the developer through a python application as it progresses in development It uses linux docker vscode pyenv pipenv and other tools for developing building and deploying an application Environment Two tools can help you setup your local development environment pyenv and pipenv Pyenv is good for getting the correct python version Pipenv is quite good at setting your virtual environment so that your versions of python and dependencies are separate from your actual machine It is the next best thing to a docker container bash bash pyenv install 3 7 0 pyenv local 3 7 0 pipenv three pipenv install module pipenv shell Not to get ahead of ourselves but when you want to install your package to your machine bash bash pip3 install Local VSCode doc python https code visualstudio com docs python python tutorial Interpreter Python is an interpreted language and in order to run Python code and get Python IntelliSense you must tell VS Code which interpreter to use bash bash pipenv where pipenv venv Within the UI View CommandPallete Python Select Interpretor bash settings json python pythonPath path to venv Debugger Linting is done with PyLint https www pylint org Linting runs automatically when you save a file PyLint messages fall into specific categories https code visualstudio com docs python linting pylint Within the UI View CommandPallete Python Enable Linting bash settings json python linting enabled true Debugger uses the Run button in the left side pane There are two standard configurations that run the active file in the editor in either the integratedTerminal inside VS Code or the externalTerminal outside of VS Code The pythonPath configuration defaults to the interpreter identified in the python pythonPath setting which is equivalent to using the value config python pythonPath Within the UI open the entrypoint file Run Debug Configuration Python File launch json is created Provide specific startup file and arguments bash launch json name Python startup py request launch program workspaceFolder startup py args port 1593 In the upper left corner of Debugger select the correct configuration Name and Run Remote VSCode doc remote

Development Commandline arguments Some important commandline arguments are subcommands and choices Subcommands are implicitly mutually exclusive In this example there are only two ways the main command can be run using generate text or check annotations The defaults allow for setting an associated function with the subcommand parser argparse ArgumentParser subparsers parser add subparsers add gen subparsers add parser generate text add gen set defaults func run add check subparsers add parser check annotations add check set defaults func check annotations Choices ensure the user has only a finite selection from which to choose The default is only used in conjunction with nargs parser argparse ArgumentParser subparsers parser add subparsers add gen subparsers add parser generate text add gen set defaults func run add gen add argument output choices drsc prep mgen help desired output format check io rsc to see formats nargs default drsc prep Comments and documentation Create docstrings like python docstrings for purpose parameters return values exceptions Directory structure Some languages such as Java and C require an implementation to be forced into a particular structure That is unfortunate because not every nail requires an enterprise ready hammer Python is different in that it allows for very flexible file arrangement and folder structure Python can be used as just a simple linear script script py Deployment Build egg bash bash MANIFEST in include hugo2lunr data word association ref json setup py package data hugo2lunr data word association ref json
