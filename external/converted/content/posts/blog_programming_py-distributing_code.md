Distributing and deploying products is a necessary step in the solution development process and an imperative in business Each solution must be thoughtfully analyzed for strengths and weaknesses especially from the perspective of security The decisons you make are largely based on the language employed to create the solution This post will describe steps taken in distributing a Python solution Introduction to Bytecode Simple python scripts are a terrific approach to getting work done quickly However in more professional environments the ease of use can make distribution tricky Python is a bytecode interpreted language so that it is disseminated as scripts Compilation is unique to the machine that runs the code Providing users with the bytecode pyc is possible but must be run by the python interpreter on the same version of virutal machine Compiled Python bytecode files are architecture independent but VM dependent A pyc file will only work on a specific set of Python versions determined by the magic number stored in the file using the following python python V output nb output Python 3 7 3 output python testfile py import imp magic num imp get magic print magic num print magic num hex output nb output b B r r n 420d0d0a output python python testfile py output nb output testfile py 1 DeprecationWarning the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib see the module s documentation for alternative uses import imp b B r r n 420d0d0a output python python m py compile testfile py python ls pycache output nb output testfile cpython 37 pyc output python python f open pycache testfile cpython 37 pyc magic f read 4 read first n characters magic encode hex output b3f20d0a not compatible Bytecode is architecture platform independent so bytecodes compiled by a compiler running in windows will still run in linux unix mac Machine code is platform specific if it is compiled in windows x86 it will run ONLY in windows x86 This is different from other popular languages such as Java which is compiled to a Java Archive jar file then run using the Java Virtual Machine jvm That was the original popularity of java it was a portable language All you needed was the correct JVM Bytecodes are the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine JVM When a JVM loads a class file it gets one stream of bytecodes for each method in the class The bytecodes streams are stored in the method area of the JVM The bytecodes for a method are executed when that method is invoked during the course of running the program They can be executed by intepretation just in time compiling or any other technique that was chosen by the designer of a particular JVM A method s bytecode stream is a sequence of instructions for the JVM Each instruction consists of a one byte opcode followed by zero or more operands The opcode indicates the action to take If more information is required before the JVM can take the action that information is encoded into one or more operands that immediately follow the opcode Distribution Methods The typical method of disseminating Python solutions is to maintain sourece code in a repository such as Github then package and upload the solution distributions sdist bdist wheel to PyPi the Python Package Index https pypi org PyPi allows projects and dependencies to be imported with a simple pip install package What s more the packaging process is quite a bit easier than that of more demanding communities such as R libraries Comprehensive R Archive Network CRAN https cran r project org This comes at a cost in that PyPi is known to have had imposters viruses to popular packages which may have one character different than the actual desired package So some care should be taken Some terminology file containing random python code module usually a single python script name py use with import my module package a module with other modules and other packages included use with from big package import specific function The egg and wheel are install artifacts that don t require building or compilation The Egg format was introduced by setuptools in 2004 whereas the Wheel format was introduced by PEP 427 in 2012 Wheel is currently considered the standard for built and binary packaging for Python egg egg deprecated built distribution setup py python file which tells system it has been packaged and distributed using Distutils to create sdist or bdist source distribution sdist archive an archive that can then be used to recompile everything on any OS platform contains py files or c cpp for binary modules and setup py binary distribution bdist wheel whl a built distribution that is specific to OS platform and Python version but can be installed and then used directly by extracting it includes pyc files python bytecode so dll dylib for binary modules but does not include setup py wheel a package format designed to ship built libraries pyc with compiled artifacts such as from C C Rust etc In contrast to the source archive the wheel includes any extensions ready to use executable exe binary file that includes both the built code with the python interpreter in a self contained distribution While providing the source code is preferred when working in a collaborative environment it is not ideal when distributing to end users who are uninterested in the internals In addition providing source code might present security concerns especially if the python developer is trying to create a closed source product Source code obfuscators exist but this approach was an after thought in python s development Typically operating systems provide a format for an executable Python can be create an executable by building with the Python interpreter through the process of freezing There are many approaches to freezing Packaging Now that we know the different types of distributions let s package a wheel for use We will use this boilerplate repo https github com IMTorgDemo Boilerplate Python as an example Build with the following command and the archive will appear in dist folder python venv pip wheel w dist verbose Perhaps you want to build your distribution for a specific environment Python version or over many combinations of the two The dockcross https github com dockcross dockcross project allows you to do this by building your distribution from different docker images python create dockcross manylinux bash driver script docker run rm dockcross manylinux x64 dockcross manylinux x64 chmod x dockcross manylinux x64 build a distributable Python 2 7 Python wheel dockcross manylinux x64 opt python cp27 cp27m bin pip wheel w dist Once you have your specific distribution move it to the target environment and install python pip install Or instead of installing simply use directly from the working directory unzip sample 0 1 0 py2 none any whl pwd python python import sys python sys path append pwd python import sample Conclusion This post prepares users with some of the basic terminology to understand different approaches to distributing Python code It also provides a small opinionated example for effectivly building a wheel and installing it on the target machine There are many choices in distributing Python code and the process is still evolving Users should consult a variety of sources to better understand the latest fashions and pertinent details References nice
