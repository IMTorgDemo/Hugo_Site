Python s Pipenv and Pyenv make a strong team for creating a cosistent development environment for exact specifications Pyenv allows you to choose from any Python version for your project Pipenv attempts to improve upon the original virtual environment venv and requirements txt file It does some things well including integration of virtual environment with dependecy management and is straight forward to use Unfortunately it doesn t always live up to the originally planned ambitious goals This cheatsheet provides commands for functionality that works and some work arounds when it doesn t Getting Started Pyenv takes care of the python binary and all related tools It stores everything under PYENV ROOT Pipenv takes care of calculating the complete set of dependencies in installation mode telling virtualenv and pip where to install the dependencies in runtime mode making available an environment with the right version of the Python interpreter via pyenv and the right set of packages via virtualenv Pipenv creates a directory that maintains your dependencies From the repo listed functionality it has interesting interaction Enables truly deterministic builds while easily specifying only what you want Generates and checks file hashes for locked dependencies Automatically install required Pythons if pyenv is available Automatically finds your project home recursively by looking for a Pipfile Automatically generates a Pipfile if one doesn t exist Automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location Automatically adds removes packages to a Pipfile when they are un installed Automatically loads env files if they exist You may hear some harping over non deterministic builds This is because Python s requirement txt file does not include versioning of required modules This can cause big problems during automated deployments Prepare Python Install pyenv python brew uninstall pyenv Install Python version python pyenv install version such as 3 7 2 Available versions python pyenv install list Change global local dir versions python pyenv global version such as 3 6 6 python pyenv local version such as 3 6 6 Prepare Development Environment Install pipenv python pip3 install pipenv Initiate directory python mkdir project cd project pipenv three or two Activate python pipenv shell Locate Venv python pipenv where output project home information python pipenv venv output virtualenv information python whereis python Check python version python python version Check path python python import sys sys executable quit Run with pipenv python pipenv run command such as python manage py runserver Add scripts to pipfile pipfile scripts server python manage py runserver And run with the following python pipenv run server Managing Dependencies Pipenv generates the file Pipfile lock which is used to produce deterministic builds Issues can occur with Pipfile lock so it is best to create a requirements txt file from your Pipenv as a backup Install from requirements txt python pipenv install r requirements txt Create requirements txt Generate requirements txt file from existing Pipfile lock without locking When you run pipenv lock r it ignores existing Pipfile lock and does locking process again There are issues around running this that are documented in this github issue https github com pypa pipenv issues 3493 python pipenv run pip freeze requirements txt Another approach is to use python pipenv lock keep outdated d r requirements txt Install and uninstall a package python pipenv install module such as camelcase python pipenv uninstall module such as camelcase python pipenv install module dev only for development such as nose Check local packages python pipenv lock r Check dependency graph python pipenv graph Ignore pipfile python pipenv install ignore pipfile Prepare Deployment Set lockfile before deployment python pipenv lock Install module s into virtual environment python pipenv install e Install module onto machine python pip install Check security vulnerabilities python pipenv check Wrapping Up Exiting the virtualenv python exit Remove the virtualenv python pipenv rm remove the virtualenv
