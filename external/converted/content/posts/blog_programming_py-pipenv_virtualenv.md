Python s Pipenv and Pyenv make a strong team for creating a consistent development environment for exact specifications Pyenv allows you to choose from any Python version for your project Pipenv attempts to improve upon the original virtual environment venv and requirements txt file It does some things well including integration of virtual environment with dependecy management and is straight forward to use Unfortunately it doesn t always live up to the originally planned ambitious goals This cheatsheet provides commands for functionality that works and some work arounds when it doesn t Getting Started Pyenv takes care of the python binary and all related tools It stores everything under PYENV ROOT Pipenv takes care of calculating the complete set of dependencies in installation mode telling virtualenv and pip where to install the dependencies in runtime mode making available an environment with the right version of the Python interpreter via pyenv and the right set of packages via virtualenv Note Pipenv can interact with setup py but it is easy to confuse Pipenv functionality with that for package distribution and installation The two are separate and packaging is out of scope for Pipenv Pipenv creates a directory that maintains your dependencies From the repo listed functionality it has interesting interaction with existing technology Enables truly deterministic builds while easily specifying only what you want Generates and checks file hashes for locked dependencies Automatically install required Pythons if pyenv is available Automatically finds your project home recursively by looking for a Pipfile Automatically generates a Pipfile if one doesn t exist Automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location Automatically adds removes packages to a Pipfile when they are un installed Automatically loads env files if they exist You may hear some harping over non deterministic builds This is because Python s requirement txt file does not dependency resolution of required modules sub dependency resolution at least not well This can cause big problems during automated deployments Pipenv solves these problems with Pipfile which is meant to replace requirements txt and the Pipfile lock which enables deterministic builds Pipenv uses pip and virtualenv under the hood but simplifies their usage with a single command line interface Prepare Python Pyenv is about ensuring your have the correct python interpreter This is similar to Node Version Manager NVM for Javascript Install pyenv python brew uninstall pyenv Install Python version python pyenv install version such as 3 7 2 Available versions python pyenv install list Change global local dir versions python pyenv global version such as 3 6 6 python pyenv local version such as 3 6 6 Prepare Development Environment Pipenv creates all your virtual environments in a default location If you want to change Pipenv s default behavior there are some environmental variables for configuration https docs pipenv org advanced configuration with environment variables Install pipenv python pip3 install pipenv Initiate directory python mkdir project cd project pipenv three or two Develop from existing repo When an exact version isn t specified in the Pipfile the install command gives the opportunity for dependencies and sub dependencies to update their versions python pipenv install dev Activate python pipenv shell Locate Virtualenv python pipenv where output project home information python pipenv venv output virtualenv information python whereis python Check python version python python version Check path python python import sys sys executable quit Run with pipenv python pipenv run command such as python manage py runserver Add scripts to Pipfile Pipfile scripts server python manage py runserver And run with the following python pipenv run server Managing Dependencies Pipenv generates the file Pipfile lock which is used to produce deterministic builds Issues can occur with Pipfile lock so it is sometimes prudent to create a requirements txt file from your Pipenv as a backup You specify the locations similarly to how you d do so with pip For example to install the requests library from version control do the following Note the e argument above to make the installation editable this is required for Pipenv to do sub dependency resolution Install from VCS python pipenv install e git https github com requests requests git egg requests Install from requirements txt python pipenv install r requirements txt Check local packages python pipenv lock r Create requirements txt You may want to generate requirements txt file from existing Pipfile lock without locking When you run pipenv lock r it ignores existing Pipfile lock and does locking process again There are issues around running this that are documented in this github issue https github com pypa pipenv issues 3493 python pipenv run pip freeze requirements txt Another approach is to use python pipenv lock keep outdated d r requirements txt Install and uninstall a package python pipenv install module such as camelcase python pipenv uninstall module such as camelcase python pipenv uninstall module pipenv uninstall all pipenv uninstall all dev python pipenv install module dev only for development such as nose Check dependency graph If there are conflicting dependencies package a needs package c 1 0 but package b needs package c 1 0 Pipenv will not be able to create a lock file and wil output an error like the following Warning Your dependencies could not be resolved You likely have a mismatch in your sub dependencies You can use pipenv install skip lock to bypass this mechanism then run pipenv graph to inspect the situation Could not find a version that matches package c 1 0 package c 1 0 As the warning says you can also show a dependency graph to understand your top level dependencies and their sub dependencies This command will print out a tree like structure showing your dependencies python pipenv graph pipenv graph reverse You can reverse reverse the tree to show the sub dependencies with the parent that requires it Ignore pipfile python pipenv install ignore pipfile Prepare Deployment Let s say you ve got everything working in your local development environment and you re ready to push it to production To do that you need to lock your environment so you can ensure you have the same one in production This will create update your Pipfile lock which you ll never need to and are never meant to edit manually You should always use the generated file Set lockfile before deployment python pipenv lock Production deployment Now once you get your code and Pipfile lock in your production environment you should install the last successful environment recorded This tells Pipenv to ignore the Pipfile for installation and use what s in the Pipfile lock Given this Pipfile lock Pipenv will create the exact same environment you had when you ran pipenv lock sub dependencies and all The lock file enables deterministic builds by taking a snapshot of all the versions of packages in an environment similar to the result of a pip freeze python pipenv install ignore pipfile Env variables Pipenv supports the automatic loading of environmental variables when a env file exists in the top level directory That way when you pipenv shell to open the virtual environment it loads your environmental variables from the file The env file just contains key value pairs env SOME ENV CONFIG some value SOME OTHER ENV CONFIG some other value Check security vulnerabilities Check for security vulnerabilities and PEP 508 requirements in your environment python pipenv check Package Distribution and Installation How does Pipenv work with setup py files There are a lot of nuances to that question First a setup py file is necessary when you re using setuptools as your build distribution system This has been the de facto standard for a while now but recent changes have made the use of setuptools optional Remember Pipenv can help in distribution but that is not within project scope Install module s into virtual environment python pipenv install e Install module onto machine python pip install Wrapping Up Exiting the virtualenv python exit Remove the virtualenv python pipenv rm
