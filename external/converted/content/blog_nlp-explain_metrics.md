Stakeholders want to understand what you are selling and how your approach is different However the level of detail they want varies greatly among your different customers A simple whitepaper can be useful enough in most situations But occaisionally a layman will want to know exactly what you are doing and will not be content until you very succinctly explain it to them This post will explain two methods for approaching such obstacles Introduction There are many types of customers and stakeholders that may be encoutered while selling analytics solutions Most non technical stakeholders do not have the time or inclination for the details of analytics They may have a colleague or subject matter expert discuss your approach during initial interactions However some parties have a real desire to understand what you are doing They may also see it as a test of your abilities that you can explain difficult concepts in a way that they can understand In any case their time is limited You will have to make your case clearly and succinctly otherwise they quickly lose patience and you lose your opportunity Two typical failures occur with the too technical and not technical enough approaches Both of these outcomes are due to a lack of preparation In the too technical case the presenter loses perspective of the forest while getting lost in the trees This is common when multi tasking Moments after implementing a difficult programming solution a data scientist is asked to join a call with a customer The scientist has little background on who it is they are engaging and their mind is working at the same level of detail they were just programming a recipe for disaster The scientist gets muddeled in tangents and the customer never gets a straight answer It finally ends long overdue with the customer frustrated and having little interest in future conversations The opposite happens when a seller is caught off guard with some difficult questions Despite the firm s large investment educating the seller with strong fundamentals the seller cannot be an expert The customer asks some technical questions incorrectly or using strange jargon Instead of deferring to an expert the seller presses on but cannot pary the customers inquiries After some stammering the customer feels they ferreted out an imposter Getting their attention again will take time These are painful experiences to undergo With preparation using the methods below the situation will occur much less frequently Methodologies The methodologies are best presented using examples There are many complicated subjects in the analytics field but one of the most common is evaluating a solution Is your solution a good one Is it better than a competitor s solution Why is your method of evaluation correct This is just a taste of the rapid fire inquisition that will take place In this NLP scenario you will need to explain what you are doing and why it makes sense The conclusion of the scenario is that an appropriate balance between precision and recall is necessary for a well performing model It is important to remember that the customer is not your advesary That may be difficult to believe A good basic assumption is that the customer spends the majority of their day looking at powerpoint and has a strong belief that 100 within a green circle is the only correct answer to any question These methods can take considerable time to iterate on the presentation in order to reach the correct balance Golden phrase method The purpose of finding the Golden Phrase is that it instantly makes abstract concepts transparent There are two difficulties discovering a good phrase and ensuring it is universally accepted Discovering a good phrase requires careful thought to create ideas and alot of repitiion trying them with customers It is important not to anchor on your first phrases instead keep brainstorming and allow customers to tell you what is correct by reacting to your words It can be very difficult to view the world from their perspective and to believe you know better than them is the greatest folly After discovering some phrases where customers do have Eureka moments it is important to validate the phrases Not only should the phrase be applicable to different customers within a shared market it should be repeatable with the same customer This is surprisingly difficult In the provided scenario explaining Precision and Recall a data scientist gave the phrase 100 Precision ensures there are no False Positives 100 Recall ensures there are no Misses The customer shouted with joy that he understood completely Alas a week went by and the phrase was used again on the same customer This time the customer was dumbfounded and had lost confidence the team s work Sometimes that is how it goes Example method This straight forward approach explains exactly what you are doing and is made clear by performing each of the steps sequentially just as it is performed The difficutly is that it is just one case so it may not be the correct balance for some audiences This is better used with executives that are content with a cursory understanding of a topic and don t ask too many questions example method nlp example method png Notice the layout is top to bottom left to right in essentially two rows This is important for the sequential steps The green text matches with the first case of naive threshold The blue text matches with the second case of balanced threshold black text is actual text gray text is supporting notes Baby steps method Baby steps are for audiences who really want to understand what you are doing but have little to no technical background While it is thorough you skip the gory details Baby steps provide the essence of what is happening in as simple an explanation as possible but not simpler We perform the process using the following steps We use models to retrieve information within electronic communications A model may produce one of four outcomes There are many methods for evaluating a model s effectiveness Precision Recall is the most effective evaluation for this NLP scenario Precision Recall have important relationships Challenges in improving Precision Recall example method nlp baby steps 1 png example method nlp baby steps 2 png example method nlp baby steps 3 png example method nlp baby steps 4 png example method nlp baby steps 5 png example method nlp baby steps 6 png example method nlp baby steps 7 png Drill down method This method can be really useful for providing the appropriate detail for many different audiences It can be conceived of as an onion Additional layers can be peeled back for greater detail and understanding The drawback is that it is very time consuming to create and also lengthy in presentation example method img PLACEHOLDER png Aspects for Iterative Improvement Some presentations are collected and used in case they are of value But others may be the key for clenching a deal These important jewels need to be continuously polished presented and updated to ensure they are ready for the next deal Is the color schema meaningful and distinctive Does the diagramming tool provide reasonable way to perceive the idea What audience is best least suited for the presentation What supporting notes should we maintain to help explain While using these presentations in practice and with customers be sure to maintain key phrases that either you or the audience says These are triggers that immediately create an ah ha moment Conclusion
