Static Site Generators are quite popular replacements for traditional server based methods of delivering HTML One of the most popular is Hugo because of its compilation speed Combining Hugo with Jupyter notebooks and other tools can provide for a speedy workflow for pushing your ideas to the web books online or pdf and more This post will discuss why you may want to do this and provides tools for doing it Creating and Sharing Ideas Creating and publishing content is an investment Even poorly created content still takes time to put text to file and file to web I ve seen many people get started with blogging only to quit after getting the site running They refine the site styling to a remarkable degree then the posts end after two weeks Which begs the question why blog A way to to have an online presence or to build a brand Rubbish No one will go to your site because you re nobody And why should they you don t care about them either Funny enough people go to Paul Graham s blog http paulgraham com articles html and I don t think he spent 10 minutes on his CSS Another perspective is that you want to share ideas with yourself and sometimes others The content I create is a knowledge base I ve learned a great deal of things I want to access reference and update those things as I refine skills and knowledge If someone asks me a question and I m feeling selfish with my time then I can point them to a post it is researched organized and documented at times that I was interested in a topic I can t remember everything all of the time Personally I m easily distracted by new ideas Creating content adds a little more time to the current work I m doing but it helps drive new ideas toward longer term interests and goals The ideas are incorporated into a previous world view that is then updated Strategically I can look over this past work and use it in future projects This is not so much to make things easier in the future as it is to see how perspectives change with the addition of new information Better yet prove to yourself that you understand some material You don t know something until you can teach to others or teach it simply to a child something like that This post is about creating this new habit and sticking to it by not wasting your time with the boring stuff An Effective Workflow Process overview I ve tried multiple workflows and the following is by far the fastest and most effective Two key components are Jupyter nobooks and Hugo Static Site Generator SSG The key components are separating your content Jupyter from the delivery Hugo and ensuring you use simple scripts for the plumbing in your workflow Docker Jupyter Markdown Hugo SSG Book online Book pdf github pages Jupyter allows you to succinctly place all of your content together even if it doesn t concern programming That way you can easily move to some new method of dissemination if SSG doesn t serve your purpose If you make programming a topic in your content you are really helping yourself The code and output are maintained together and can easily be update in the future Using simple scripts bash or python files to automate your work ensures that plumbing can be created easily and quickly modified when you improve your process or make major changes to it This might seem like more overhead and it is in the short term But having the ability to direct your content to and reuse it in different sources such as blog post book or a journal format is incredibly powerful Detailed process To go into more detail I start with a docker image with Jupyter installed The docker container shares volumes with the local space for saving ipynb files These are maintained in a github repo so all content is secure and easily reproducible The only concern is where to keep your accompanying data which is mostly dependent on size An AWS S3 bucket is usually a safe bet Once the content is ready it can be prepared for dissemination using a simple script Jupyter notebook files ipynb are json These should be converted to markdown md and placed with dependencies images media etc into the appropriate Hugo directory structure A final review can be performed by running Hugo locally Changes can be made to the markdown files the Hugo public directory converted HTML SSG files is commited and pushed to github repo for publication on github pages All of this can be done in less than 30 seconds There are some similar but less flexible workflows If you are using RStudio https www rstudio com and are only concerned with data science content using R or Python then you can use blogdown https bookdown org yihui blogdown This is a great workflow and really saves the user much time However both RStudio and blogdown are opinionated and large If you want to change something then you will either have to do it their way if the option is present or you will have to dig knee deep into code probably for several days to modify things to how you want them This lack of control does not suite me Complete process code For docker images I use one of the following all spark notebook all the data science goodies you expect beakerx strong multi language and prototyping support including JVM languages python and javascript bash create your notebook repo git clone repo bash profile export NOTEBOOK HOME Users jason beach Desktop Projects IMTorgDemo Notebooks create container and share volume docker run d p 8887 8888 v NOTEBOOK HOME home beakerx PROJECTS PERSONAL v WORK HOME home beakerx PROJECTS WORK name cntr beakerx beakerx beakerx Apply consistent formatting across notebooks Using a script to look for such formatting can be helpful The following are useful standards when running the nb2hugo https github com IMTorgCustomSoln nb2hugo script for converting a notebook to markdown notebook name must be lowercase ipynb Title As Above ipynb or part of metadata md All Second Sections to ensure proper smartToc All third sections use opening paragraph beneath metadata ensure either output or markdown cell between code cells reference other posts with absolute url my post ref posts blog page todo md List of Future Posts add external references to documentation ref http domain com add image references description images name png Convert the file to markdown and place files and dependencies into appropriate directory structure bash nb2hugo directory to file ipynb site dir Hugo Site section posts Take a quick look for final review bash hugo server D Then commit and deploy to github pages Also commit and push your notebook modifications to github repo deploy sh add new post This is a simple process once it is set up The only difficulty is getting accustomed to the above formatting rules Jupyter for code and content Jupyter notebooks can be real productivity enhancers because they bring code output and mathematical notation all under one JSON based HTML renderer The notebook can be shared as HTML or converted to other formats While docker is not necessary running Jupyter from docker can make costly installation and configuration changes both automated and portable Two of the best images are all spark notebook https github com jupyter docker stacks tree master all spark notebook all the data science goodies you expect beakerx http beakerx com strong multi language and prototyping support including JVM languages python and javascript The kernels of these two images cover almost every language you might want to use except NodeJs I ve tried a few of different set ups but haven t found any that are consistently maintained Once you ve completed some work in a notebook you have a variety of different formats for which to convert it Converting it to markdown and diseminating files to Hugo is my chosen workflow and the script nb2hugo https github com IMTorgCustomSoln nb2hugo performans quite well by making use of the Jupyter API I m slowly improving it with post processing Hugo for static sites SSGs improved steadily over the last few years and Hugo proclaims it is the fastest for compiling code The speed is quite impressive and allows users to see HTML updates while the underlying markdown is being modified similar to how nodemon https nodemon io works for Node developers Hugo is also relatively simple to learn and customize The basic tutorials https gohugo io documentation are quite good Installing the system with code block language coloring pygments is straightforward brew install hugo pip3 install Pygments pip3 install nb2hugo Typically a new user will get started with a theme chosen from the Hugo Theme library https themes gohugo io The actual theme repo is cloned within the Hugo directory structure hugo new site quickstart cd quickstart git init cd themes git clone depth 1 https github com carsonip hugo theme minos hugo t hugo theme minos The final bit is to customize Hugo using the config toml file This includes adding the url and other static site variables the chosen theme and parameters associated with the theme and static pages like About or Tags Creating a new post from markdown without Jupyter is simply hugo new posts my first post md Hugo has some very powerful themes to choose from including academic https themes gohugo io coder portfolio https themes gohugo io hugo coder portfolio tufte style https github com shawnohare hugo tufte book style https themes gohugo io hugo book Mathematical notation is supported through Katex https katex org docs supported html Useful Tools To deploy Hugo simply place the compiled public directory to a server You have many options however deploying your site simply by pushing commits to your code repo is one of the easiest enter GithubPages https gohugo io hosting and deployment hosting on github The provided Hugo script is quite useful Later you can create a custom domain name and point it at the account github io url such as with Namecheap https www namecheap com support knowledgebase article aspx 9645

distributing your content using other means such as book pdf Pandoc https pandoc org appears to cover all needs for markdown transformations The writer Thorsten Ball https thorstenball com blog 2018 09 04 the tools i use to write books appears to have good experience on this process as well Conclusion There are many choices for distributing content to the web but I find most are time consuming in either overhead process or customization This is not the case with Jupyter and Hugo Overhead is only a few hours for set up and getting accustomed to styling The process only takes a two commands and a localhost review Customization cannot be any easier because of the simplicity of the pipeline and scripts If fewer languages or less flexibility is acceptable than RStudio and blogdown may be preferable but this may be regretful later
