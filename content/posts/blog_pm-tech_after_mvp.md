You built it, it works, but you're far from monetization or even consistent users.  So, how do you proceed?  Below is a list of questions to ask yourself.

* Did you solve the problem for which you originally targeted?
* Is the original problem that you intended to solve still important?
* Oftentimes, you may need to decompose the problem in greater detail: What aspects of the problem are users most concerned?
* The greater problem depth will lend to 2-3 detailed solution methodologies: How (by what criteria) should we best solve it?
* Solution methodologies and associated tools should be explored (for their utility and practicality) before committing to them: How do we manually perform the steps of this method?  If you can solve it manually, then it may be a good candidate for automation.
* Tests can be created from these manual steps which will then be used to prove the automated solution works as intended: Do our result follow from the intended theory?
* Selling your product could be difficult because stakeholder scope must be appropriate.  There should be a good Product Owner who can represent the needs of all the intended users.  The Product Owner should validate the problem is decomposed, correctly.  Executives / investors funding the product will want to see proof the solution solves the problem
* Explain the solution with diagrams / visuals that describe the methodology(ies) in order to build confidence.  

To prove the solution, the application results should match expected output for manually-derived test cases

Recommendations for moving forward:

* step away from the current product
* work through the steps explained, above
* determine if future functionality should be integrated with the current application (if so, then how)
* create a strong plan with detailed tasks to implement

Don't invest or commit too much - you may have to go through this process again!
